About Code:
------------------------------------------------------
Theory:
------------------------------------------------------
Key Points:
& - accesses address of the variable
*p -  used to declare a pointer
* is also termed as the de-referenceing operator. 
*p gives the value at address stored in p.

A Pointer can be assigned to an array.
Pointer to an array will point to the 0th element.
Arrays are contiguous in memory. 
Incrementing the pointer will make it point ot the 1st element.
